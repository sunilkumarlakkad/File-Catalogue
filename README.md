# File-Catalogue

• Utilized the C++ STL containers and iterators to analyze the directory structure on the local machine, looking for duplicate file names and searching for text in specified files
• constructed a catalog of all files in the file set, saving each file name only once and saving each path only once, while preserving all of the containment relationships between directories and their files
